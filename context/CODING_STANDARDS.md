# honeybee_REVIVE_grasshopper — Coding Standards

## 1. IronPython 2.7 for canvas code

The generic dual-runtime rules (banned syntax and modules, comment-style type
hints, guarded `typing` imports, defensive third-party imports, and the lint
settings they imply) live in the **ironpython-27-compatibility** skill. Apply it
before editing anything on the Rhino load path. Only this repo's specifics are
recorded below.

**Zone split:** everything in `honeybee_revive_rhino/` that runs on the
Grasshopper canvas is IPy2.7-safe. `scripts/` is CPython.

No pandas or numpy on the canvas. Heavy compute is routed to CPython through
`honeybee_revive_rhino/gh_compo_io/run_subprocess.py`; see section 2.

## 2. The subprocess boundary

Heavy compute — ADORB, pandas-based resilience graphs — runs in **CPython**, invoked from the IPy2.7 side via `honeybee_revive_rhino/gh_compo_io/run_subprocess.py`. A `GHCompo_*` class that needs heavy compute marshals its inputs, calls the subprocess, and reads results back. Do not try to run pandas/`ph-adorb` heavy paths in-process.

## 3. The component contract

- Logic in `gh_compo_io/<subcat>/<name>.py` (`GHCompo_*`); thin wrapper in `honeybee_revive_grasshopper/src/<Name>.py`.
- **Registry entry mandatory** in `_component_info_.py` for any new/renamed component; names match across wrapper, `ghenv.Component.Name`, and registry key.
- `.ghuser` regenerated inside Grasshopper; commit regenerated `src/*.py` + `user_objects/*.ghuser` together.

## 4. Formatting

- **Black** + **isort**.

## 5. Verification

- Run the **validation comparisons** in `tests/` (`resilience/comparison/`, `adorb/comparison/`) against the Phius reference models. That is the correctness check here; there is no separate unit-test suite.

## Closeout checklist

- [ ] Canvas code is IPy2.7-safe (no f-strings/pathlib; guarded `typing`; comment hints; wrapped 3rd-party imports; **no pandas/numpy**).
- [ ] Heavy compute routed through `run_subprocess.py` to CPython.
- [ ] Registry entry added/updated; names consistent; `.ghuser` regenerated + committed.
- [ ] Relevant `tests/…/comparison/` still match the Phius references.
- [ ] black + isort clean; version not hand-edited.
